## Web Escape Game as a contribution against Sexual Harassment / Catcalling

Whenever I hear about dangerous situations of my friends in darkness or bad experiences with strangers, I get very ashamed and afraid and ask myself whether I am able to detect situations of harassment. Would I know what to do?

I want to do something useful and entertaining at the same time, so I decided to reuse an old [online escape game project](https://rwetenkamp.de/escapegame/) to build something that let us train our dealing with dangerous situations.

It is just an idea - maybe a good one, maybe not. Let's see what comes out in the end. ðŸ˜‰
  
> This project substitutes the project "TheCatCallsBack" which was discontinued due to spam activites in October 2022.
